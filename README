Task-Template-Benchmark

This distribution contains no actual code, it simply exists to provide
a list of dependencies to assist in quickly installing all template engines
and optional dependencies used by Template::Benchmark.

Be warned, between them, the 34 modules installed by this task have a
huge number of dependencies and prerequisites, on a fresh build of Perl
with only Bundle::CPAN installed this will run for over 20 minutes.

The current release of Task::Template::Benchmark aims to always track
the dependencies required by the current release of Template::Benchmark.

However, it should also be perfectly safe to use the current
Task::Template::Benchmark with an older install of Template::Benchmark
- you'll most likely only end up installing some extra modules that won't
be used by that older version.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build installdeps
